/**
 * The reading surface for brains that cost nothing.
 *
 * 116,587 notes sit in 131 free public brains — 85% of everything the
 * catalogue holds — and until now none of it was published anywhere. A brain's
 * page shows fourteen note TITLES out of some nine hundred, so the entire
 * indexable surface of the site was 184 pages of description. robots.txt even
 * carried `Disallow: /b/*&#47;notes` for a route that did not exist.
 *
 * The unit is the category, not the note. A note is often two sentences —
 * 116k pages of those is a thin-content farm, and search engines are right to
 * treat it as one. Grouped by category the same corpus becomes 5,602 pages,
 * 3,281 of them holding five notes or more: coherent, specific, and exactly
 * the shape of the question somebody types.
 *
 * Nothing paid is ever exposed here. The test is gateFor() — the same one the
 * paywall uses — so a free child of a paid family stays shut, and there is no
 * second definition of "free" to drift from the first.

 * crawler that meets it, and useless to a reader looking for one answer. Sixty
