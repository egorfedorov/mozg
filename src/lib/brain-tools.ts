/**
 * The hands a brain's knowledge needs.
 *
 * A brain says how something is done. Some of what it teaches is done far
 * better by a tool on the reader's own machine — and the agent has no way to
 * learn that, so it follows the by-hand notes straight past a machine that
 * would have done the job. This is the brain naming its own tools, so the
 * brief can hand them over before the first search.
 *
 * Three rules the rest of this file exists to keep:
 *
 *   1. mozg never runs them. They are local tools against local files, and in
 *      Spine's case a licensed desktop app. We ship the knowledge that they
 *      exist, not a promise to be them.
 *   2. mozg cannot see whether the reader has one. Our server has no view of
 *      the agent's own tool list, so every word rendered here is an
 *      instruction to go and look, never a claim about what is connected.
 *   3. The text is untrusted. It is written by whoever owns the brain and read
 *      by an agent that can execute shell commands — see sanitise().
