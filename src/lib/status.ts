 * which meant "is mozg up" had two different answers depending on who asked.
 * One function now, two readers: the JSON probe uptime monitors poll, and the
 * public page a person opens when something feels slow.
 *
 * Everything here is either a live ping (database, embedder) or a count over
 * rows the product already writes. Nothing calls a paid model to find out
 * whether paid models work: the last day of extractions already said so, and a
 * status page that bills per refresh is its own outage.
