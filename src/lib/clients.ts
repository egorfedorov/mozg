/**

 * One thing worth stating plainly, because it is the most common confusion:
 * MCP is a client feature, not a model feature. Kimi, DeepSeek and GLM are
 * models — you use them inside one of the clients below. A model on its own
 * has nothing to connect to.
 *
 * Every snippet here is taken from that client's own documentation. A config
 * that does not work is worse than no page at all.
