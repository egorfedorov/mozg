 * here, in CI, on a self-hoster's laptop behind a firewall — depended on a
 * third party answering. It failed twice in one afternoon with "Error while
 * requesting resource" and nothing wrong in the code. A build that breaks for
 * reasons outside the repository is one nobody can reproduce or trust.
 *
 * Cyrillic is carried on its own unicode-range subset rather than merged in:
 * brains hold Russian notes, a fallback glyph in a note title is the fastest
 * way to make a product feel unfinished, and an English-only reader still
 * downloads only the Latin file. See scripts/fetch-fonts.mjs.
