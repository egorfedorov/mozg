 * MCP endpoint — JSON-RPC 2.0 over HTTP.
 *
 * Hand-rolled rather than wired through the MCP SDK: its streamable transport
 * wants Node `req`/`res`, App Router hands us a Web `Request`, and the shim
 * between them is more moving parts than the protocol itself. A stateless
 * tools-only server needs `initialize`, `tools/list`, `tools/call` and `ping`.
 *
 * Auth is a bearer token (see /settings/tokens):
 *   claude mcp add --transport http mozg https://mozg.sh/mcp \
 *     --header "Authorization: Bearer mzg_..."

 * Why the call was refused, in words the agent can act on.

 * whose MOZG_TOKEN was never exported, and the shell then sends the header
 * literally — the agent reads a bare 401, tells its user the brain is
 * unavailable, and nobody learns that one export line fixes it. Every branch
 * here names the fix.
